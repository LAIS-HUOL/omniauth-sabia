**This file is based on [intridea's README](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth-github/blob/v1.3.0/README.md).**

This is the official OmniAuth strategy for authenticating to Sabi치. To
use it, you'll need to sign up for an OAuth2 Application ID and Secret
on the [Sabi치 Developers Page](https://desenvolvedores.sabia.ufrn.br/).

## Basic Usage

You must remember to set scopes in order to get granular access to different types of data:

```ruby
use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider OmniAuth::Strategies::Sabia, ENV['SABIA_KEY'], ENV['SABIA_SECRET'], scope: "cpf email"
end
```
